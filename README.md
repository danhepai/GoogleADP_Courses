Hello world! My name is Dan Gașpar, and I am a Computer Science student at Babeș-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science.

This repository houses all the projects I completed during my attendance at the Python Course by "Școala Informală de IT," 
a course I discovered through Google Developer Student Clubs.

The projects might contain mistakes but this is not meant to be a perfect repository, but an one which will keep track of my progress. Thanks for stopping by.
